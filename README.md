Lexical Analyzer Program

This program is designed to analyze Python files (.py) and generate tokens as output. Please follow the instructions below for compiling and running the program:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Place the Python files (.py) you wish to analyze in the "examples" folder located in the same directory as the lexycal.py file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the lexycal.py file.

4. Run the lexycal.py file using the following command: python3 lexycal.py

5. When prompted, enter the filename of the Python file you want to analyze (including the .py extension). Ensure that the file is located in the "examples" folder.

6. The program will analyze the specified Python file and generate a result.

7. After the program finishes running, you can find the result in a .txt file located in the "results" folder. The name of the result file will be the same as the Python file you entered.

8. Review the generated tokens in the result file to see the lexycal analysis output.

9. Repeat steps 4-8 for analyzing additional Python files if needed.
